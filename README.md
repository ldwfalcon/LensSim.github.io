This project is a simple simulation/visualization of how light, if it were a particle, changes it's path when travelling through a medium.

Live demo is available at <https://ldwfalcon.github.io/LensSim.github.io/>

You can create new objects by clicking and holding left mouse button - the longer you hold the bigger the objects will be.
